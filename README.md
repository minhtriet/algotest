I implemented a binary tree for dtring deduplication

`algotest`: The source folder
Put a csv file in `algotest` and pass its name to the command prompt. If no file is passed, it would default to `algorithms part dataset.csv`

`TreeTest`: The test folder
A test for the binary tree implementation from `algotest`
